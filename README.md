The System is a independent Theft Detection and Tracking device which can be mounted in any type of automotive vehicle. 
It has the capability to detect any kind of consistent movement of the vehicle which then triggers an alarm 
when the movement exceeds a certain threshold value. The threshold value is maintain as to avoid  false alarms 
which may be caused due to any kind of slight unintentional movement. The alarm is transmitted to the owner's
mobile phone where he can access the details of his vehicle  through a mobile app where he'll be able to detect the 
current location of his vehicle thus enabling him to monitor his vehicle in real-time.

**Tech Involved:**  
1. **Arduino**: A microcontroller board used for integrating all the following modules into a single functioning unit.  
2. **Accelerometer**: Used as a motion sensor that detects any 3D(x,y,z-axis) motion.  
3. **GPS module**: Used locating the live location of the device. 
4. **SIM module**: Used for transmittion of messages ober a mobile network.
